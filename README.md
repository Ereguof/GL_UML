# Génie Logiciel - UML

A government agency for environmental protection needs to monitor the air quality of a large
territory. The agency has installed a number of sensors for this purpose, which are spread evenly over
the territory. The sensors generate data at regular intervals. The data are gathered by the agency and
stored on a central server in a set of files in CSV format.


## Guide to build the executables 

While in the project folder :
`>> make`

`>> ./main`
-> to use the main app (interactive app, actual software)

`>> ./mainTestsUnitaires`
-> to use the test executable (non-interative, allows testing for the implemented functions and measures their performance)
