GÃ©nie Logiciel - UML

A government agency for environmental protection needs to monitor the air quality of a large
territory. The agency has installed a number of sensors for this purpose, which are spread evenly over
the territory. The sensors generate data at regular intervals. The data are gathered by the agency and
stored on a central server in a set of files in CSV format.
